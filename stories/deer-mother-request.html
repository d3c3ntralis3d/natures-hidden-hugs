                <div class="synopsis-content">
                    <p class="synopsis-lead">
                        It's rare for a wild animal to approach a human, but maternal instinct can override fear. I was
                        walking near the edge of the woods when a doe stepped out, looking directly at me. She didn't
                        run; instead, she made a distressed sound and took a few steps back into the trees, pausing to
                        see if I would follow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Realizing she wanted me to follow, I cautiously entered the brush. She led me about a hundred
                        yards to a thicket where her fawn was tangled in an old wire fence. The baby was exhausted from
                        struggling, lying still but breathing rapidly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the mother watching closely from a safe distance, I worked to untangle the wire. It took
                        ten tense minutes, but finally, the fawn was free. It wobbly stood up, shook itself off, and
                        bounded over to its mother. She licked its face, looked back at me one last time, and they
                        vanished into the forest together.
                    </p>

                        species."
