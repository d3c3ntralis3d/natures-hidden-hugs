                    <p class="synopsis-lead">
                        Recovery is hard enough on your own, but for Leo, a once-active tabby cat, a major surgery left
                        him confined to a cone and unable to move freely. His spirit was broken, and he spent most days
                        lying simply staring at the wall, refusing to engage with his family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then came Milo. A tiny, fearless foster kitten with limitless energy and an even bigger heart.
                        Initially, the family worried Milo might be too much for the recovering Leo. But animals have an
                        intuition that often surpasses our own. Instead of pouncing, Milo approached the "cone of shame"
                        with gentle curiosity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What started as a tentative sniff turned into a daily ritual. Milo would curl up next to Leo,
                        purring loudly—a natural healing frequency for cats. He'd groom the spots Leo couldn't reach
                        because of the cone. Slowly, the light returned to Leo's eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't just a story about healing a broken bone; it's about healing a broken spirit. Milo
                        showed us that sometimes the best medicine isn't a pill—it's the presence of a friend who
                        refuses to leave your side when you're at your lowest.
                    </p>

                                comforting companionship.

                        Thanks to Milo's constant companionship, Leo made a full recovery. The cone came off, and today
                        they chase each other through the house as equals. What started as a temporary foster situation
                        turned into a forever friendship—Milo was officially adopted into the family.
