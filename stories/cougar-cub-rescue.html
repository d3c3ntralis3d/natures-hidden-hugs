                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <div class="synopsis-content">
                    <p class="synopsis-lead">
                        When a tiny, malnourished cougar cub was found alone by the roadside, no one expected what would
                        happen next. But love doesn't always follow the rules—sometimes it crosses species boundaries
                        entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cub was barely three weeks old, dehydrated and crying for a mother who would never come.
                        Wildlife rescuers knew her chances were slim without round-the-clock care. That's when an
                        unlikely hero stepped forward: a domestic tabby cat named Rosie, who had recently lost her own
                        litter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What happened next defied everything we thought we knew about animal behavior. Rosie, her
                        maternal instincts still strong, immediately accepted the wild cub as her own. She groomed her,
                        kept her warm, and even attempted to nurse her. The bond that formed was instant and
                        unbreakable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For eight weeks, this extraordinary pair was inseparable. Rosie taught the cub—now named
                        "Willow"—how to play, how to groom, and how to feel safe in a world that had started so harshly.
                        Though Willow eventually needed to transition to a wildlife sanctuary, the foundation Rosie gave
                        her made all the difference.

                    <p>
                        Today, Willow lives at a wildlife sanctuary where she has space to roam and be wild. She's grown
                        into a healthy, confident cougar—but she still perks up at the sound of a house cat's meow.
                        Rosie, now a beloved companion, occasionally visits the sanctuary. When they see each other,
                        something magical happens: Willow still grooms Rosie like she did when she was a tiny cub.
